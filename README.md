# Visualizer

A simple music visualizer built as a small day project as I was just interested in music visualization at the time.

The photos are taken from the song "Sit Next To Me" by Foster and the People. 

 #### To use the visualizer:
* Include your song of choice in the same repository as "sketch.js".
* Edit "song" var in "sketch.js" to include your choice mp3.
